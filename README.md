# Facial-Recognition
Using the AT&amp;T Faces dataset ([ORL]() Database of Faces), this Python script uses machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Logistic Regression) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial recognition.  The models work to identify the subject in the image from a known database of 40 individuals each with 10 images.
